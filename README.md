# UROP

About the repo:

Containing ANN setup code, ANN training code using LM method, and simulation script.
I am only the owner of the TestMovingWindow.m file, the rest is used with authorisation from the respective owner.
TestMovingWindow.m simulates dynamic ANN operation (propagation + training) for continuous time where sensor data is gradually 
fed into the ANN. This script also features selective ANN training where training will only occur in case of a large error.
